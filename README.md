# League of Legends Statistical Analysis

## Introduction

### Introduction to League of Legends

League of Legends (LoL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games. It was released in 2009 and has since become one of the most played video games in the world. The League of Legends World Championship is the largest esports event in the world by popularity, attracting millions of viewers and players worldwide.
The `league` dataset used in this analysis contains data from professional LoL matches, developed by Oracleâ€™s Elixir. While Oracle's Elixir has been collecting data since 2014, I use data from the most recent complete season, 2024, for my analysis.

In the game, there are various monsters which when killed, provide buffs and various advantages to the team that kills them. The most important of these monsters is deemed by most players to be Baron Nashor. Baron Nashor is the most powerful neutral monster in the game that spawns in the Baron pit after 20 minutes of gameplay, and has a respawn time of 6 minutes. Killing Baron Nashor grants a powerful buff to the team that kills it, and teams often shape their late game strategies around this key objective, which plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of matches.

This analysis is centered around the question: **To what extent does getting the first Baron affect a team's performance in a match?**
I use data science techniques to analyze the impact of securing the first Baron on various match statistics as well as the overall match outcome. The culmination of this analysis is a machine learning model to predict a team's performance at the time when the first Baron spawns. This model holds the potential to be used as a real-time analysis tool for teams and analysts during matches, providing insights into the current state of the game and helping teams make informed decisions.


### The Dataset

The dataset provided by Oracle's Elixir contains detailed statistics with 161 features and 117,576 rows. I will focus on a few key features, described below:
- `gameid`: A unique identifier for each match.
- `datacompleteness`: A string indicating the completeness of the data for that match (complete or partial).
- `league`: The professional league tournament in which the match was played (e.g. LCK, LPL, LCS).
- `side`: The side of the map on which the team played (Blue or Red).
- `gamelength`: The total length of the match in seconds.
- `result`: The outcome of the match for the team (1 for a win, 0 for a loss).
- `firstbaron`: A binary indicator of whether the team secured the first Baron (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `[stat]at20`: Various statistics at the 20-minute mark of the match, including gold, xp, cs, kills, deaths, assists. Each statistic will be explained more in detail when needed.



## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning

I first filtered the complete dataset to only include the features relevant to my analysis. Then I converted the `result` column to `win`, containing boolean values for whether the team won the match or not. While the dataset contained data on both player and team statistics, I focused on team statistics for my analysis and hence dropped all rows corresponding to player statistics. Since Baron Nashor spawns at 20 minutes, I also filtered the dataset to only include matches that lasted at least 20 minutes, or 1200 seconds.

There are 2778 rows where the `firstbaron` value is null. Note that all the `[stat]at20` values are also null in the rows where the `firstbaron` is null, and they are only null in these rows. These rows are indicated by a `datacompleteness` value of `partial`, which indicates that there may have been issues collecting this data for specific games. While traditional data cleaning usually also handles missing values, I held off on this step until after my assessment of the missingness of the data.

Below is the first five rows of the `league_cleaned` dataset:

| gameid             | datacompleteness   | league   | side   |   gamelength | win   |   firstbaron |   goldat20 |   xpat20 |   csat20 |   killsat20 |   assistsat20 |   deathsat20 |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|:---------|:-------|-------------:|:------|-------------:|-----------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|--------------:|-------------:|
| 10660-10660_game_1 | partial            | DCup     | Blue   |         1886 | False |          nan |        nan |      nan |      nan |         nan |           nan |          nan |
| 10660-10660_game_1 | partial            | DCup     | Red    |         1886 | True  |          nan |        nan |      nan |      nan |         nan |           nan |          nan |
| 10660-10660_game_2 | partial            | DCup     | Blue   |         1911 | False |          nan |        nan |      nan |      nan |         nan |           nan |          nan |
| 10660-10660_game_2 | partial            | DCup     | Red    |         1911 | True  |          nan |        nan |      nan |      nan |         nan |           nan |          nan |
| 10660-10660_game_3 | partial            | DCup     | Blue   |         1324 | True  |          nan |        nan |      nan |      nan |         nan |           nan |          nan |


### Univariate Analysis

I performed univariate analysis on the `gamelength` and `killsat20` features to understand their distributions.

The histogram above shows that the distribution of `gamelength` is roughly normal, and slightly right-skewed. This is expected, as most matches are designed to last around 25-35 minutes, but some matches can go on for longer due to various factors such as team compositions and strategies, especially in professional matches where teams are highly skilled and often evenly matched.

The histogram above shows the distribution of team kills at the 20-minute mark of the game. Note that while the distribution looks roughly normal and slightly right-skewed, we see an abnormally high number of 0 kills at 20 minutes. While it is unlikely that a professional team would have 0 kills this late into the game, it is possible that the data itself is messy. However, it is hard to differentiate between the two possibilities, and hence leave the data as is for now, while keeping this in mind for my analysis.


### Bivariate Analysis

I perform bivariate analysis on the `firstbaron` and `win` features to understand the relationship between whether securing the first Baron affects the outcome of the match. I use a bar plot to visualize the this relationship:

  src="assets/firstbaron-win-plot.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

Interpreting the plot, we see that a significantly higher percentage of teams that secured the first Baron won their matches compared to those that did not. This suggests that securing the first Baron has a positive impact on a team's chances of winning the match. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and further analysis is needed to confirm this relationship.


### Interesting Aggregates

In this section, I compute some interesting aggregate statistics:

|   firstbaron |   gamelength |      win |   goldat20 |   xpat20 |   csat20 |   killsat20 |   assistsat20 |   deathsat20 |
|-------------:|-------------:|---------:|-----------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|--------------:|-------------:|
|            0 |      1887.36 | 0.183115 |    33877.5 |  40995.2 |  685.581 |     5.3017  |       10.0476 |      7.48551 |
|            1 |      1910.35 | 0.842747 |    36075.6 |  42593.5 |  707.21  |     7.46865 |       14.3972 |      5.14195 |

Computing the mean across the columns, I get the following aggregate information:

|   firstbaron |    mean |
|-------------:|--------:|
|            0 | 6145.8  |
|            1 | 7111.55 |

This suggests that teams that secured the first Baron have a higher average across various game statistics compared to those that did not. This further supports the hypothesis that securing the first Baron has a positive impact on a team's performance in the match.



## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis

In the original dataset, I noticed that the `ban1`, `ban2`, `ban3`, `ban4`, and `ban5` columns contained a significant number of null values with no discernible pattern. I strongly believe that this column is NMAR (Not Missing At Random). This is because before every League of Legends game starts, players are allowed to ban certain champions from being played in the game. I believe that this data is NMAR because a player may choose not to ban any champion, and hence the missingness of this data depends itself.

To determine whether this data is instead MAR (Missing At Random), an additional data I would need would be a boolean column indicating whether a player chose to ban a champion or not.


### Missingness Dependency

As mentioned previously, many rows in the `league_cleaned` dataset have `NaN` values for the `firstbaron` and `[stat]at20` columns, indicated by a `datacompleteness` value of `partial`. In this section, I try to determine whether the missingness of the `firstbaron` column depends on other columns. In particular, the columns I will use to determine this are the `league` and `side` columns. For both cases, I use a permutation test with a 1% significance level to determine whether the missingness of the `firstbaron` column depends on the `league` and `side` columns.

First, I perform a permutation test on the `league` column.

**Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of `league` when `firstbaron` is missing is the same as the distribution of `league` when `firstbaron` is not missing.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The distribution of `league` when `firstbaron` is missing is not the same as the distribution of `league` when `firstbaron` is not missing.

**Test Statistic**: Total Variation Distance (TVD). This is appropriate because we are comparing two categorical distributions.

**Significance Level**: 1%

Below is the observed distribution of the `league` column when `firstbaron` is missing and not missing:

| league          |   firstbaron_missing = False |   firstbaron_missing = True |

After performing the permutation test, I computed an observed test statistic of 0.4953203743700504 and got a p-value of 0.0. Below is a plot of the empirical distribution of the test statistic from the permutation test, along with the observed test statistic:

<iframe
  src="assets/league-simulation.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

Hence, I reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the distribution of `league` when `firstbaron` is missing is not the same as the distribution of `league` when `firstbaron` is not missing. This suggests that the missingness of the `firstbaron` column is MAR on the `league` column.


Next, I perform a permutation test on the `side` column.

**Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of `side` when `firstbaron` is missing is the same as the distribution of `side` when `firstbaron` is not missing.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The distribution of `side` when `firstbaron` is missing is not the same as the distribution of `side` when `firstbaron` is not missing.

**Test Statistic**: Total Variation Distance (TVD). This is appropriate because we are comparing two categorical distributions.

**Significance Level**: 1%

The observed distribution of the `side` column when `firstbaron` is missing and not missing is as follows:

| side   |   firstbaron_missing = False |   firstbaron_missing = True |
|:-------|-----------------------------:|----------------------------:|
| Blue   |                          0.5 |                         0.5 |
| Red    |                          0.5 |                         0.5 |

In this case, I computed an observed test statistic of 0.0 and got a p-value of 1.0. Below is a plot of the empirical distribution of the test statistic from the permutation test, along with the observed test statistic:

<iframe
  src="assets/side-simulation.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

Hence, I fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the distribution of `side` when `firstbaron` is missing is the same as the distribution of `side` when `firstbaron` is not missing. This suggests that the missingness of the `firstbaron` column is not dependent on the `side` column.


### Handling Missing Values

Now that I have completed my assessment of the missingness of the data, I can handle the missing values in the `firstbaron` and `[stat]at20` columns. Counting the nulls, I find that there are 2778 out of 19510 rows with null values. Since I cannot impute these values (no way to know if a team got the first baron or not), I drop these rows by dropping all rows with a `datacompleteness` value of `partial`. I also drop the `datacompleteness` column, as it is no longer needed. Lastly, without any missing values, I convert the `firstbaron` and `[stat]at20` columns from floats to integers as that is the appropriate data type for these columns.

Below is the first five rows of the `league_cleaned` dataset after handling the missing values:

## Hypothesis Testing

In this section, I aim to determine whether there is a (positive) relationship between securing the first Baron and the amount of gold a team has at the 20-minute mark of the game. In order to show a positive relationship, I choose the difference in mean gold between teams that get the first Baron and teams that do not get the first Baron as my test statistic, without taking the absolute value.

**Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of gold (at minute 20) of teams that get the first baron is the same as the distribution of gold (at minute 20) of teams that do not get the first baron.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: Teams that get the first baron are more likely to have more gold at minute 20 than teams that do not get the first baron.

**Test Statistic**: Difference in mean gold between teams that get the first baron vs do not get the first baron.

**Significance Level**: 1%

Computing the observed test statistic, I get a value of 2198.1607960016045. Below is a plot of the empirical distribution of the test statistic from the permutation test, along with the observed test statistic:

The p-value obtained from the permutation test is 0.0, which is less than the significance level of 1%. Hence, I reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant positive relationship between securing the first Baron and the amount of gold a team has at the 20-minute mark of the game.

Note that since this is not a randomized controlled trial, we cannot definitively say that securing the first Baron causes a team to have more gold at minute 20. We can only make inferences about the relationship between the two variables. However, the strong evidence against the null hypothesis suggests that there is indeed a positive correlation between securing the first Baron and having more gold at minute 20. This result is significant as it indicates that securing the first Baron is a key factor in determining a team's performance in the match, and teams should prioritize this objective in their strategies.



## Framing a Prediction Problem

In League of Legends, gold is a key resource and is arguably the most important statistic in the game. Players use gold to buy powerful items that improve their champions' statistics, and is often considered a good indicator of whether a team is winning or losing.

In past sections, I showed that teams that got the first baron, on average, won more games than teams that did not get the first baron. I also showed that teams that got the first baron are more likely to have more gold at minute 20, by performing a hypothesis test.

Thus, the prediction model I will build in the following sections will be based on the following prediction problem: **Can we predict the amount of gold that a team may have at minute 20, based on their other statistics at this point of the game?**

Since gold is numerical data, this model will logically be a regression model. At the time of prediction, the predictive model will have the following information: `firstbaron`, `league`, `csat20`, `xpat20`, `killsat20`, `deathsat20`, `assistsat20`, and `goldat20`. I will evaluate my predictive models on the $r^2$, RMSE (root mean square error), and MAE (mean absolute error) metrics.
- $r^2$: This metric measures how well of a fit the model is to the data.
- RMSE: This is a popular metric used to measure the amount of error in a regression model.
- MAE: This metric also measures the amount of error in a regression model, but is less sensitive to outliers than RMSE, and is easier to interpret.



## Baseline Model

For my baseline model, I use a simple linear regression model trained on the following features: `firstbaron` and `csat20`.

Why I chose these features:
- `firstbaron`: From our previous analysis, we saw that teams that got the first baron are more likely to have more gold at minute 20.
- `csat20`: CS (creep score) is the number of minions or monsters that a player has killed. It is the primary way to gain gold in the game, and is thus a strong predictor of gold at minute 20.

Among these features, `firstbaron` is nominal while `csat20` is numerical. Since `firstbaron` is already in binary format, I do not need to perform any encoding on it. However, I do need to standardize `csat20` to ensure that both features are on the same scale. I use the `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to standardize `csat20`.

After splitting the data into training and testing sets, I fit the baseline model on the training data using the `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model`. While the use of `StandardScaler` is not necessary for linear regression, it helps with interpretability of the coefficients and is good practice when working with features on different scales.

I then evaluate the model on both the training and test sets using the $r^2$, RMSE, and MAE metrics.

| Evaluation Metric   |   Training Set Performance |   Test Set Performance |
|:--------------------|---------------------------:|-----------------------:|
| R Squared           |                   0.192689 |               0.193629 |
| RMSE                |                2395.02     |            2456.89     |
| MAE                 |                1837.42     |            1879.66     |

Though the evaluation metrics are slightly worse with the test data than the training data, they are still very similar, so we can conclude that the model generalizes well.

The low $r^2$ value of 0.193629 suggests that there are other important features that we have not included in the model that could improve its performance. The RMSE and MAE values are also quite high, indicating that the model is not very accurate in predicting the amount of gold at minute 20. This is expected, as we are only using two features to make our predictions. In the next section, we will improve upon this baseline model by adding more features to the model and/or tuning hyperparameters to improve its performance.



## Final Model

To improve upon my baseline model, I first create a residual plot to see if there are any patterns in the residuals. A residual plot is a scatter plot of the residuals on the y-axis and the predicted values on the x-axis. If there are any patterns in the residuals, it suggests that the model is not capturing all of the information in the data.

The vertical spread is quite uniform, indicating that the linear regression model is appropriate for this data. However, the two clusters of points in plot, indicates that there may be two different distributions of data in the dataset. Using my knowledge of the game, I think this could be due to the fact that I am using data from multiple leagues, and the teams in these leagues may have different playstyles and strategies.

To create a better final model, I include the `league` and `xpat20` features. I will also engineer a new feature called `kdaat20` that is the ratio of (`killsat20` + `assistsat20`) to `deathsat20`.

Relationship between each feature and gold at minute 20:
- `league`: Different leagues may have different playstyles and strategies, which could affect the amount of gold a team has at minute 20. For example, the LPL is known for its aggressive playstyle, which may lead to more kills and thus more gold.
- `xpat20`: While XP (experience points) and gold are separate resources, they are often gained simultaneously. For example, killing a minion or monster grants both XP and gold. This may sound similar to CS, however, some actions, like killing a player, may provide XP and gold but not CS, and vice versa.
- `kdaat20`: KDA is a common aggregate of kills, deaths, and assists in a game. It measures a player's or team's performance in the game.
  - Kills and assists are directly correlated with gold, as they provide gold when a player gets a kill or an assist.
  - Deaths, however, are not directly correlated with gold, as they do not cause you to lose gold. Instead, when you die, you miss out on potential gold earnings from minions, jungle camps, or objectives during your death timer. Additionally, your death rewards gold to the enemy team if they secure a kill, which can contribute to their overall gold advantage.

Of these new features, `league` is nominal, while `xpat20` and `kdaat20` are numerical. I encoded `league` using one-hot encoding (`OneHotEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`) to convert it into a numerical format. I also standardized `xpat20` and `kdaat20` using the `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.

After finalizing which features I will use for my final model, I use polynomial features (`PolynomialFeatures` from `sklearn`) to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target. Note that in the `PolynomialFeatures` step, a degree needs to be set. This is a hyperparameter for which I need to use cross-validation techniques to find the optimal value. I first used `GridSearchCV` for this task, however, due to computational constraints, I switched to `RandomizedSearchCV` to perform the same task in a more efficient manner. I tested degree values from 1 to 10, with 4-fold cross-validation, and found that the optimal degree value is 2.

Fitting the final model on the training data using the `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model`, I then evaluate the model on both the training and test sets using the $r^2$, RMSE, and MAE metrics.

| Evaluation Metric   |   Training Set Performance |   Test Set Performance |
|:--------------------|---------------------------:|-----------------------:|
| R Squared           |                   0.624591 |               0.603781 |
| RMSE                |                1633.21     |            1722.21     |
| MAE                 |                1270.59     |            1336.26     |

All the training and testing metrics have improved significantly from the baseline model, indicating that the final model is indeed better. While the evaluation metric values are still not great, from the residual plot above we saw that the data had high variance, so we may not be able to improve the model much further without overfitting. We can also create a residual plot of the final model to see if there are any patterns in the residuals:

In the plot above, the vertical spread is still quite uniform, and the clustering pattern we saw in the baseline model is no longer present, indicating that the final model is indeed better than the baseline model.



## Fairness Analysis

In this section, I will assess if my final model is fair across different groups.
I choose to segregate the groups based on the `side`. Specifically, the question I try to answer in this section is: **Does my model perform differently for the red side vs the blue side?**
To answer this question, I performed a permutation test and examined the result of the difference in MAE (Mean Absolute Error) between the two groups. I used the MAE instead of the RMSE because the MAE is more interpretable and is less sensitive to outliers. Since in this case, I only want to determine whether there is a difference, I take the absolute value of the difference in MAE for my test statistic.

**Null Hypothesis**: The final model is fair. The MAE of the model is the same for the red and blue sides

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The final model is unfair. The MAE of the model is different for the red side than it is for the blue side.

**Test Statistic**: Absolute difference in MAE.

**Significance Level**: 1%

After computing an observed test statistics of 10.87667126602014, I performed a permutation test and obtained a p-value of 0.488. Below is a plot of the empirical distribution of the test statistic from the permutation test, along with the observed test statistic:

  src="assets/fairness.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

With a p-value of 0.488, which is greater than the significance level of 1%, I fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the final model is fair across the two groups. This suggests that the model performs similarly for both the red and blue sides, and there is no significant difference in its performance based on the side of the map on which a team plays.
